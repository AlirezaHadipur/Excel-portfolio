Hi üñê.

In this repository, I created an Excel sheet file because I just finished an Excel tutorial on YouTube and I wanted to implement a project to improve my knowledge of Excel.

This project is divided into 3 parts, the first part is for cleaning the data, and I also created a PowerPoint presentation to make it clearer for readers.
The second part is about creating pivot tables, and the last part is about creating dashboards to visualize data.
